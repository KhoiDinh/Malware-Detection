The idea is to create a web-based Antivirus application that allows the users to upload a file (of any type) to check if
it contains malicious content. That is, if it is a Malware or not.

You will have to:
Build a web page that:
- Ensures a secure Session mechanism.
- Allows the user to submit a putative infected file and shows if it is infected or not.
- Lets authenticate an Admin and allows him/her to submit a Malware file, plus the name of the uploaded Malware.
- When an Admin adds the name of a malware during the uploading of a Malware file, it ensures that the string contains
only English letters (capitalized or not) and digits. Any other character, or an empty string, must be avoided.

Build a web application that:
- Reads the file in input, per bytes, and, if is Malware, stores the sequence of bytes, say, the first 20 bytes
(signature) of the file, in a database (Note: only an Admin can upload a Malware file)
- Reads the file in input, per bytes, and, if it is a putative infected file, searches within the file for one of the
strings stored in the database (Note: a normal user will always upload putative infected files)

Build a MySQL database that:
-Stores the information regarding the infected files in input, such as name of the malware (not the name of the file)
and the sequence of bytes
-Stores the information related to the Admin with username and password, in the most secure way of your knowledge.


- admin uploads file containing malware errors (store into db), user enters in file and checks by 20 bytes to see if
error is in malware uploaded file by admin
- 2 tables malware, admin credentials

- NEED TO SANITIZE INPUTS. ASK IF REQUEST OK TO GET ELEMENTS FROM HTML
- js check for malware name
-PREPARE STATEMENT; ASK IF YOU DID IT RIGHT AND THEY WAY YOU DID IT WORKS WITH REQUIREMENTS
